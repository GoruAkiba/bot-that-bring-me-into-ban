Dear lovely Mod, `Toji`

here is my essay to elaborate all thing happened tonight.

## My Regrets

I regret to ma all the bad stuff I was made of.
but if u read it, here I'll tell u about what I did research with ma bot.
I'll tell you all possibilities and bot limitations then what Hollocraft had done to suppress bot capability.

> 1.  First, __I regret what I did__ then I'll never do the bad thing (Bot -ing on Hollocraft Server) again.
> 2.   2nd, I appreciate all things u do to prevent bad things happen to hollocraft server, __i appreciate ur mod__.
> 3.   yeah __I disobey the rule__, I did Bot -ing to collect more resources (Strings for CNY event purposes). one thing u need to know, im doing this at ma private farm (ma spider spawner).
     it just one time i did trial this bot into the public mobspawn, but its not effective (i'll elaborate this case then).

## The Chronologies

i was in ma office when i got a direct message from ma friend that __The CNY event will end quite soon__. so, i think i should collect a lot of material before the event ended and exchange stuff closed.
its weekend, I can go home early cuz of half-day shift. __consider ma armor was break and ma Withering trident getting lost when i join at last pvp event__. 
i miss ma Withering trident and ma Life II armor. __i need to get another one before the event ended__.
***

it was a long night gathering all resources to gain the Withering and Life book exchange. for a while i think, im losing ma time when i tryna to get ma first Book. should i spend same time to the other one?, I asking to myself.
FYI im a tech enthusiast and this case challenge ma mind. I remember, i was build a minecraft bot last year. what i need are slain mob using looting to double the drop then i can farming another material in public farm using ma main account.

```
a shulker and 9 stacks of bone, one shulker of string, and 9 shulker of gunpowders that's all i need for each book to exchange. i calculate that i need to farm till tomorrow to gain all resources.
so i decide to make Bot to help me Looting spider at my private spider farm.
``` 
***

i rewrote ma code using `mineflayer` libs and `replit`, 
its `11:36 am GMT+7` im sill in ma office when im rewrote the code. 
`2:00 pm` that's ma shift off, but hard rain comes. i decide to stay along the rain and back to my code.
about 2hr i finish ma __script to bypass BOT Verifying method__ that Hollocraft have.
it is such a nice (Holocraft) system, that prevents dirty IPs from trying to connect and detecting suspicious activity.
at this point, REPLIT (or another free hosting service) IPs block needed, it'll suppress bot connect possibilities.
***

after getting home, `6:00 pm` i continue ma code to complete the bot `/tpa system`. i also __add eval capabilities__ to make the bot can iteract with server command like `/warp` etc.
so bassically, i can manage bot to do `/warp mobfarm`, or `/sethome` even direct message to someone.
***

`7:35 pm` __i start to develop pvp system and guarding system__, the feature which can help me to farm mob with a certain radius. when it done, it'll help me alot to farm the materials.
my __first guarding tester was in ma skelly farm__. i did give trust to ma bot account ("`kiba_serpent`"). all doing well, but after the entity nears bot was nan strange thing happen. ma _bot detecting entity behind the wall then with their pathFinder they decide to break the wall_ and kill the mob. not finish yet, they ruin ma spawner room by breaking ma redstone contraptions.
from this, i conclude that, is a bad thing to activate guarding (or entity hunt) system when you set in long radius and give trust to the bot account. cuz bot can break block to reach the nearest entity.
so i decide to __navigate ma bot into ma 2nd spawner (spider spawner)__ and make ma friend to claim it, so bot cant break the block suround him. 
***

`break for a while`, __i need to fixing ma skelly spawner.__
i continue ma operation at `9:50 pm`. __ma 2nd testing, i navigate bot into mobfarm using `/warp mobfarm`. im tryna to collect gunpowders.__ but something happens, i found something interesting things about public mobfarm, something odds. `this slab prevent bot pathFinder to find exac position to hunt entity`. __Great job Hollocraft Builder__, at POV of normal player those two slab can be calculate as hole with 2 block heights. but in the bot vision, that slab predicted as full block so, bot calculates that block as 1 block then this state ruins Mob killing task. whatever bot trying to reach the Mob, they will try to break the upper slab to get 2 block hole to reach the Mob. this case will break the hunting operations cuz bot getting confused by pathFinder. even tpa bot into specifict place above the slab, the 2nd atempt will ruin the step.

so __I apreciate to Hollocraft builder__, that awesome build.
***

then i decide to __bring back ma bot into ma private mobfarm__. i returned to farming string with the bot guarding me using looting V. long story short, i had collect 9 stack string an more when i did setup red_dye farm and bunch `kick by Vulcan advantage reasons` ma bot jailed for 5hr. 
***

i c that MOD doing great Jobs by tracking this issue and listing all strange things behind the console. then im arrested after the bot jailed.
idk what part got me discovered, is that by tracking party member of ma bot and me? is that kick count of ma bot? is that mod discover me msg the bot and sending specifict command?
i dont know...

one thing that iknow, you Toji as head mod doing great job to prevent bad things happen to hollocraft server.
capturing ma bot also jailed me with appropriate punishment

5 hr nah ....
12 hr is enough for me to regret it
but __Ban_Hammer was spoken__.

## Ending
`Through this essay, I hope Mod will be kind`, and `forgive me`
also with this essay __i bring all information i can provide to bring better place to Hollocraft__

- better mod blocked all free hosting IPs and the subdomain to prevent Bot -ing.
- that block of slab, unthinkable thing, and i never thought. that awesome
